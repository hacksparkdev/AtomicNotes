## USB Connector Types
The connector form factors specified in USB 2 are as follows:

- Type A—For connection to the host and some types of peripheral device. The connector and port are shaped like flat rectangles. The connector should be inserted with the USB symbol facing up.
- Type B—For connection to large devices such as printers. The connector and port are square, with a beveled top.
- Type B **Mini**—A smaller peripheral device connector. This type of connector was seen on early digital cameras but is no longer widely used.
- Type B **Micro**—An updated connector for smaller devices, such as smartphones and tablets. The micro connector is distinctively flatter than the older mini type of connector.
