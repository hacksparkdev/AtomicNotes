## Quick Notes

A **personal area network (PAN)** refers to using wireless connectivity to connect to devices at a range of a few meters. A PAN can be used to share data between a PC and mobile devices and wearable technology devices, such as smart watches. It can also connect PCs and mobiles to peripheral devices, such as printers, headsets, speakers, and video displays. As digital and network functionality continues to be embedded in more and more everyday objects, appliances (the Internet of Things "IoT"), and clothing, the use of PANs will only grow.
