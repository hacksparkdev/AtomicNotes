## Quick Notes

### **Local Area Network (LAN)**
A group of computers connected by cabling and one or more network switches that are all installed at a single geographical location. 
- This could be a single floor.
- Or a whole college campus. 
- As long as they are withing 1 mile of each other. 
- 802.3 Standards maintained by the [[institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE)
Sure! Let me break it down:

The **IEEE 802.3 standards** use a naming system like **xBASE-Y**, where:

- **x** is the speed (how fast data can move). For example:
  - "100" means 100 megabits per second (Mbps).
  - "1000" means 1000 Mbps or 1 gigabit per second (Gbps).
  - "10G" means 10 gigabits per second (Gbps).

- **BASE** refers to "baseband," which is the way the data signals are sent (directly, without multiple channels).

- **Y** tells you the type of cable being used. For example:
  - "T" means **twisted pair copper cables** (the common wires used in networks).

### Examples:
1. **100BASE-T**: Moves data at 100 Mbps using twisted pair cables. (Often called Fast Ethernet.)
2. **1000BASE-T**: Moves data at 1 Gbps using twisted pair cables. (This is common in most local area networks (LANs).)
3. **10GBASE-T**: Moves data at 10 Gbps using twisted pair cables. (Super fast, used in high-speed networks.) 

In simpler terms, the name tells you **how fast the connection is** and **what type of cable it uses**.


### Wireless LANs

A **wireless local area network (WLAN)** uses radios and antennas for data transmission and reception. Most WLANs are based on the IEEE 802.11 series of standards. IEEE 802.11 is better known by its brand name, Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi and Ethernet technologies complement one another and are often used together as segments within the same local network. This allows computers with wired and wireless networking adapters to communicate with one another.

### Wide Area Networks

Where a LAN operates at a single site, a **wide area network (WAN)** spans multiple geographic locations. One example of a WAN is the Internet, a global network of networks. A company dedicated to facilitating access to the Internet from local networks is called an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

Most private or enterprise WANs use cabling and equipment leased from an ISP to interconnect two or more LAN sites. For example, a company might use a WAN to connect branch office sites to the LAN at its head office.

### Metropolitan Area Networks

M**etropolitan area network (MAN)** can be used to mean a specific network type covering an area equivalent to a city or other municipality. It could mean a company with multiple connected networks within the same metropolitan areaâ€”so, larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.
