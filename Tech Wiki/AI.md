## **1. Foundational Concepts in AI**

### **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
- **Definition:** AI refers to machines that mimic cognitive functions like learning, problem-solving, and reasoning.
- **Types of AI:**
  - **Narrow AI:** Focused on specific tasks (e.g., recommendation systems, chatbots).
  - **General AI:** Hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can.
  - **Super AI:** Beyond human intelligence, currently theoretical.

### **Machine Learning (ML):**
- **Definition:** A subset of AI where models improve at tasks through experience (data) rather than explicit programming.
- **Key Types:**
  - **Supervised Learning:** Learns from labeled data (e.g., spam classification).
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
  - **Reinforcement Learning:** Learns by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback (e.g., game-playing bots).

### **Deep Learning (DL):**
- **Definition:** A subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers to learn from vast amounts of data.
- **Common Uses:** Image recognition, speech processing, natural language understanding.
