## Quick Notes

### **Trusted Platform Module(TOM)**
is a specification for hardware-based storage and digital certificates, cryptographic keys, and hashed passwords.The TPM establishes a root of trust. Each TPM microprocessor is hard coded with a unique, unchangeable key, referred to as the endorsement key. During the boot process, the TPM compares hashes of key system state data (system firmware, boot loader, and OS kernel) to ensure they have not been tampered with. The TPM chip has a secure storage area that a disk encryption program such as Windows BitLocker can write its keys to.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wmx-api-production/courses/35001/images/532-1635781356788-tpm.png)
