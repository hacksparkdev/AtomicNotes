## Quick Notes
### **Three Approaches to Solving IT Problem**

- **Repair** - You need to determine whether the cost of repair make this the best option. 
- **Replace** - Often more expensive and may be time-consuming if a part is not available. There may also be an opportunity to upgrade the part or software. 
- **Workaround** - Not all problems are critical. If neither repair nor replacement is cost-effective, it maybe best either to find a workaround or just to document the issue and move on.
