## Encryption 
Encryption encodes data using a key to give it the property of confidentiality. Many cryptographic processes also make use of hashing. A secure hash is a unique code that could only have been generated from the input. Hashes can be used to compare two copies of data to verify that they are the same. Unlike encryption, the original data cannot be recovered from the hash code.
