In a computer, a bus is a communication system that transfers data between different components. Think of it like a highway that allows information to travel between the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage, and peripheral devices. Buses carry data, addresses, and control signals, allowing these parts to work together smoothly.

There are different types of buses for different tasks:

    Data bus: Carries the actual data between components.
    Address bus: Carries memory addresses so the CPU knows where to access data.
    Control bus: Carries control signals to coordinate operations.

Examples include the system bus (connecting the CPU and main memory) and the I/O bus (connecting peripherals). Buses can also differ in speed and data width, affecting a computer's performance.
