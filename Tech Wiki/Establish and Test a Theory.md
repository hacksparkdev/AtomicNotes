## Quick Facts
**Conduct Research**
- Make a physical inspection -- Look and listen. You may be able to see or hear a fault(Scorched motherboard, "Sick" sounding disk drive, no fan noise, and so on)
- If the problem is not longer apparent, reproduce the problem. Recreate the exact circumstances that produce the failure or error in the first place. 
- Check documentation. 
- Make sure another technician hasn't worked on the computer. of if they did what did they do? 
**Question The Obvious**
- Decide whether the problem is hardware or software related. 
- Decide which hardware subsystem is affected.
- Decide whether the problem is in the disk unit or connectors and cabling. 
- Test your theory.
