## Binary Data Storage and Transfer Units
Transfer rates are expressed in units per second of the following multiples of bits and bytes:

    1000—Kilobits (Kb/s or Kbps) and kilobytes (KB/s and KBps).
    1000x1000—Megabits (Mb/s) or megabytes (MB/s).
    1000x1000x1000—Gigabits (Gb/s) and gigabytes (GB/s).
