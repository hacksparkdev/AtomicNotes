## Quick Notes

### **Implement Preventive Measures**
- Eliminating any factors that could cause the problem to reoccur. 
	- EX: If a computer is infected with a virus, ensure that the antivirus software is updating itself regularly and users are trained to avoid malware risk. 

### **Document Findings, Action, and Outcomes**
- Documenting the problem, action, and outcome is a good way to keep track of the systems and using the documentation for future problems tat may arise in the same category as the problem.
