### **Hard Determinism** 
> 
>     - The belief that all events are caused by past events such that nothing other than what does occur could occur.  
> 
>     - Every event is caused by a previous event.
> 
>     - An agent can have never done anything than what they did. 
> 
### **Causal Determinism**

> 
>   - **Definition**: This is the most common form of determinism, stating that every event or state of affairs is the result of preceding events in accordance with natural laws.
> 
>   - **Implication**: If we knew all the laws of nature and the state of the universe at a given time, we could predict every future event with certainty.
> 
> 
> 
###  **Logical Determinism**
> 
>   - **Definition**: This perspective argues that all propositions about the future are either true or false. In this view, the truth of future events is determined by current truths.
> 
>   - **Implication**: This raises questions about free will and whether our choices can be considered genuinely free if they are already "true" in a logical sense.
> 
> 
> 
###  **Theological Determinism**
> 
>   - **Definition**: This form posits that a deity or divine being determines all events in the universe, including human actions. Theological determinism often relies on the belief that God has foreknowledge of all events.
> 
>   - **Implication**: This leads to discussions about free will in the context of divine omniscience—if God knows everything that will happen, can humans still have free will?
> 
> 
> 
### **Physical Determinism**
> 
>   - **Definition**: This type asserts that the physical laws of nature govern all phenomena. In a physically deterministic universe, everything, including human behavior, can be explained by physical laws and interactions.
> 
>   - **Implication**: This aligns with scientific perspectives, particularly in classical mechanics, where every particle's movement can be predicted based on its initial conditions.
> 
###  **Psychological Determinism**
> 
>     - **Definition**: This view suggests that human behavior is determined by psychological factors, including desires, motivations, and conditioning experiences.
> 
>     - **Implication**: It raises questions about moral responsibility and the extent to which individuals can be held accountable for their actions if those actions are the result of psychological influences.
> 
###  **Biological Determinism**
> 
>       - **Definition**: This perspective posits that biological factors, such as genetics, determine human behavior and traits.
> 
>       - **Implication**: This view can lead to debates about nature versus nurture, suggesting that our biology heavily influences our choices and personalities.
> 
###  **Environmental Determinism**
> 
>         - **Definition**: This approach emphasizes the role of environmental factors (such as culture, upbringing, and social conditions) in shaping human behavior and decisions.
> 
>         - **Implication**: It implies that individuals’ actions are largely determined by their circumstances and the context in which they live.
> 
###  **Hard Determinism vs. Soft Determinism (Compatibilism)**
> 
>     - **Hard Determinism**: This view holds that determinism is true, and as a result, free will is an illusion. If every action is predetermined, then individuals cannot be truly free.
> 
>     - **Soft Determinism (Compatibilism)**: This perspective argues that free will and determinism are compatible. It suggests that even if our actions are determined, we can still be considered free if we act according to our motivations and desires.
