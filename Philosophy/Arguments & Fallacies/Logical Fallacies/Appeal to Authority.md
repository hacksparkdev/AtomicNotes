> This argument is commonly known as an _appeal to authority_, or _argument from authority_, where someone dismisses another's opinion or argument on the grounds that they lack formal qualifications or expertise. Here are the core elements behind this reasoning, the flaws within it, and some counterpoints:
> 
> 
### Core of the Argument
> 
> 1. **Expertise Requirement:** The argument suggests that only people with specific degrees, certifications, or extensive experience in a field have valid insights or opinions on that topic.
> 2. 
> 3. **Credibility:** It assumes that formal credentials equate to a higher level of understanding or authority, which should automatically outweigh views from those without such credentials.
> 
> 
### Logical Flaws
> 
> 1. **Experience Doesn't Guarantee Objectivity:** While expertise can provide valuable insights, it doesn’t guarantee objectivity or correctness. Experts can hold biased views or be mistaken, just like anyone else.
> 
> 2. **Knowledge Is Widely Accessible:** Information on almost any subject is more accessible than ever, meaning that anyone dedicated to learning can gain significant understanding without formal credentials.
> 
> 3. **Insight Doesn’t Require Authority:** Some insights or critiques don’t need deep technical knowledge or professional experience, especially when discussing general concepts, moral implications, or philosophical questions.
> 
> 4. **Discourages Critical Thinking:** Relying solely on authority can prevent constructive dialogue, as it shuts down discussion instead of addressing ideas on their own merit.
> 
> 
> 
### Counter Points
> 
> 1. **Ask for Evidence, Not Credentials:** Encourage the discussion to focus on supporting evidence rather than formal qualifications.
> 
> 2. **Highlight Self-Education as Valid:** Point out that self-study and a genuine understanding of the topic often provide a fresh perspective or can bring valuable critique.
> 
> 3. **Challenge With Relevant Examples:** If applicable, use examples where people outside the formal discipline contributed valuable insights (like self-taught programmers, historical thinkers, or autodidacts in fields like literature or philosophy).

### Example of Countering the Argument
> 
> If someone dismisses your view on cybersecurity because you don’t have a degree, you might respond:
> 
> 
“While I don’t hold a degree in cybersecurity, I’ve studied and practiced the fundamentals extensively, focusing on practical labs and real-world applications. My understanding comes from this direct experience, and I’m always open to constructive feedback.”
