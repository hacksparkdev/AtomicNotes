Coming up with strong main points involves identifying the key ideas that support your overall topic or argument. Here’s a step-by-step approach to help you generate main points:

### 1. **Define Your Core Message**
   - Start by asking, *“What’s the main purpose of this piece?”* Your core message or argument will guide the main points you develop. For example, if your topic is *“Why Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges are essential in cybersecurity education,”* your main points should revolve around the unique benefits and relevance of CTFs.

### 2. **Ask Supporting Questions**
   - Break down your core message by asking *“Why?”* and *“How?”* questions. This helps you find natural categories for main points. Using the CTF example, you might ask:
     - *Why are CTFs valuable in cybersecurity?*
     - *How do CTFs improve technical skills?*
     - *What specific skills do CTFs develop that are hard to learn elsewhere?*

### 3. **Identify Key Benefits, Features, or Impacts**
   - Think about benefits, features, or impacts related to your topic. For example:
     - *Benefits of CTFs*: hands-on experience, real-world skill application, community learning.
     - *Impact of CTFs*: improved engagement, practical knowledge retention, teamwork.

### 4. **Group Related Ideas Together**
   - As you brainstorm, similar ideas will naturally group together. If you notice you’re mentioning “real-world applications” and “hands-on practice” in different places, you can combine them into a single main point about practical experience.

### 5. **Use the Rule of Three**
   - Aim for three main points for simplicity and effectiveness (though more can be fine depending on the depth). Three points provide enough coverage without overwhelming readers.

### 6. **Look for Unique Angles or Gaps**
   - Consider what perspectives might be missing from typical discussions of your topic. This helps make your main points stand out. For instance, with CTFs, you might focus on how they uniquely foster both independent problem-solving and team collaboration, which might be less common in traditional training.

### 7. **Review and Prioritize**
   - Once you have several ideas, ask yourself which points are *most* relevant to your core message. Pick the points that add the most value and support your main argument directly.

### Example Process for “Benefits of CTFs in Cybersecurity Training”

- **Core Message**: CTFs are essential tools for practical cybersecurity education.
- **Supporting Questions**:
   - Why are they essential? (Answer: They provide real-world practice.)
   - How do they help learners? (Answer: They build practical skills and motivation.)
   - What makes them unique? (Answer: They simulate real attacks and defense in a controlled environment.)
- **Key Benefits (Main Points)**:
   1. **Hands-On Skill Development** – CTFs provide real-world simulations that help learners develop practical cybersecurity skills.
   2. **Increased Engagement and Motivation** – Gamified learning keeps participants interested and driven to improve.
   3. **Teamwork and Real-World Problem Solving** – CTFs teach collaboration and allow learners to solve problems similar to those in actual cybersecurity roles.

This approach guides you to well-rounded, focused main points that reinforce your main message effectively.
