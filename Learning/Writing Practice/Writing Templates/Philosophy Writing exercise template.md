### Philosophy Opinion-Building Exercises

1. **Thought Experiment Reflection**:
   - **Prompt**: *“Do you think personal happiness or moral duty should come first?”*
   - **Exercise**:
     - Reflect on this question and outline your gut response.
     - List an example where prioritizing happiness might lead to positive outcomes and another where moral duty might be more beneficial.
     - Form an opinion statement: “I believe that [personal happiness/moral duty] should come first because…” and support it with your examples.

2. **Argument Exploration**:
   - **Prompt**: *“Is life better lived with certainty or with constant questioning?”*
   - **Exercise**:
     - Break down both sides: what certainty offers (e.g., stability, security) and what questioning offers (e.g., growth, deeper understanding).
     - Choose a stance, and write 2–3 sentences supporting your view.

3. **Personal Connection to Philosophical Concepts**:
   - **Prompt**: *“How does the Stoic principle of focusing only on what you can control resonate with your life experiences?”*
   - **Exercise**:
     - Write a few lines about a time when focusing on controllable things helped or hindered you.
     - State your opinion on whether the Stoic approach is universally useful or if there are limits to its effectiveness.

By working through these exercises regularly, you’ll strengthen your ability to form opinions and feel more confident in expressing them. Try expanding on your answers over time, gradually building complexity in your arguments.
