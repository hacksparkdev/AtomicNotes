## Ideas

3. **Machine Learning (ML) Models for Alert Prioritization, Anomaly Detection, and Correlation**

- **Languages**: Python (for model development) and potentially JavaScript (for embedding models into microservices).

- **Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch for model training; MLflow for model versioning and tracking.

- **Structure**:

- **Training Pipeline**: Build ML models for log correlation and anomaly detection using historical data. These models can be trained offline and deployed as microservices.

- **Inference Pipeline**: Use a REST API to deploy the trained models, making predictions in real-time as logs stream in.

4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Log Summarization**

- **Libraries**: Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers (for summarization models) or spaCy (for simpler NLP tasks).

- **Languages**: Python, due to its wide library support for NLP.

- **Structure**: NLP modules can run independently as microservices, summarizing logs and flagging key insights. Models should be deployed in an environment like Flask or FastAPI for scalability.
