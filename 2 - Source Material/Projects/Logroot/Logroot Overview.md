## Concept Overview:
1. **ELK Stack**:
    - **Elasticsearch** stores logs and task results.
    - **Logstash** collects logs from workstations.
    - **Winlogbeat** is considered for collecting Windows Event Logs.
2. **Python Scripts**:
    - These scripts run various **cybersecurity modules** (e.g., file integrity monitoring, log collection, malware detection) on Windows workstations.
    - The Python scripts are modular, allowing the dynamic addition/removal of modules.
    - Results are sent back to Elasticsearch in JSON format for further processing.
3. **Node.js Server**:
    
    - A **dashboard** is being developed using Node.js, Express, and EJS for viewing logs, running modules, and analyzing data.
    - You want to allow analysts to interact with the system, running tasks and viewing real-time results.
    - The dashboard includes a way for admins to assign tasks to analysts and for real-time monitoring of logs and alerts.
4. **Task Management System**:
    
    - Tasks (e.g., running a module, analyzing logs) are assigned to analysts automatically based on job roles and availability.
    - Tasks are managed in **Elasticsearch**, and a **MongoDB** database is used to store information about user roles and task automation logic.
5. **Alerts and Automation**:
    
    - You want to automate the assignment of tasks based on alerts generated from logs, helping analysts respond faster to security incidents.
    - The goal is to make it easy to detect threats, analyze them, and assign the response to the right role.
6. **Real-Time Log Monitoring**:
    
    - You're working on displaying real-time logs from security event logs in the dashboard, and ensuring that these logs continue to be displayed as they are collected.


### Technologies Being Used:

- **Python**: For building modular cybersecurity tools.
- **Node.js**: For developing the dashboard and managing communication with Elasticsearch.
- **Elasticsearch**: For storing logs and task results.
- **MongoDB**: For managing user roles and automation logic.
- **Winlogbeat/Logstash**: For log collection from Windows systems.

You are currently working on areas such as improving the dashboard, integrating modular scripts, and expanding automation features for better threat detection and response.

Does this match what you're working on, or is there something specific you'd like to clarify or focus on?

## Key Points:
### **Goals**:

- **Automation**: You aim to automate threat detection, response, and task management.
- **Modularity**: You want to develop modular Python scripts that perform specific tasks, and integrate them into the system dynamically.
- **Real-Time Visibility**: The dashboard should provide real-time visibility into logs and incidents, enabling analysts to interact with the system efficiently.
- **Role-Based Task Management**: Task assignment will be handled automatically based on analyst roles and availability, with support for tracking and analyzing task progress.

## Related Notes:
- **Addition**
	-  Wanting to add Ansible to my project. 
	- I could use Ansible in my project for scheduling tasks like vulnerability scanning tasks. 
	- I would be better to use for tasks that need to be scheduled. I could use it to deploy my python workers to each station.
