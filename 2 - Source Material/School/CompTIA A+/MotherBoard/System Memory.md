## Summary:
System memory is used to temporarily store data and instruction for use by the Central processing unit. (CPU)

---


## Detailed Notes:
- Random Access Memory
	- Is non persistent, when the power is off the data is erased. 

- Swap
	- if there is not enough space n memory disc storage is used 
	- This is call a page file

- Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory. (DDRSDRAC)
	- Synchronizes with the clock.
	- Makes 2 data transfers per clock cycle. 

-  Dual inline memory module (DIMM) 
	-  Used by desktop. 
	- The motherboards bus speed needs to match ram speed. 
 - Small Outline Dual inline memory module (SODIMM)
	 - Used in Laptops

- Error Correcting Code Ram  
	- Every transfer is hashed &  stored.
	-  The check sum is evaluated & checked for the same hash
	- This is used for server & Workstations.
