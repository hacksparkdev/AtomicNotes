## Summary:
RAID is a technology that combines multiple physical disk drives into a single logical unit to achieve data redundancy, improve performance, or both. RAID is commonly used in servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, and high-availability systems.

Here’s a breakdown of the different RAID levels:

## Detailed Notes:





---

### **RAID 0 (Striping)**

- **Purpose**: Performance enhancement
- **How It Works**: Data is split (striped) across multiple disks without redundancy.
- **Advantages**:
  - Increases read/write speed since multiple disks are used simultaneously.
  - Full capacity of all disks is available.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - No fault tolerance. If one disk fails, all data is lost.
- **Best Used For**: High-speed applications where data loss is not a concern (e.g., video editing).

---

### **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**

- **Purpose**: Redundancy
- **How It Works**: Data is duplicated (mirrored) onto two or more disks.
- **Advantages**:
  - High redundancy: If one disk fails, the other(s) still have the data.
  - Simple recovery from disk failure.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Only 50% of the total disk space is usable (the other half is the mirror).
  - No performance increase in write operations (slight improvement in read).
- **Best Used For**: Systems where data redundancy is critical (e.g., servers with important databases).

---

### **RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)**

- **Purpose**: Balanced performance and redundancy
- **How It Works**: Data is striped across multiple disks with parity information distributed across the drives. If one disk fails, the data can be reconstructed using the parity information.
- **Advantages**:
  - Good read performance.
  - Fault tolerance with efficient use of storage (only one disk's worth of capacity is used for parity).
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Write operations are slower due to parity calculations.
  - Data recovery takes time if a disk fails.
- **Best Used For**: General-purpose systems with a balance of speed, storage efficiency, and redundancy (e.g., file servers).

---

### **RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity)**

- **Purpose**: Enhanced fault tolerance
- **How It Works**: Similar to RAID 5 but with two sets of parity, allowing the array to survive the failure of two disks.
- **Advantages**:
  - Can tolerate two simultaneous disk failures.
  - Good read performance, with slightly lower write performance due to double parity.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Even slower write performance compared to RAID 5.
  - Requires more disks for the same amount of usable storage (due to extra parity).
- **Best Used For**: Systems that require high redundancy (e.g., large databases, mission-critical systems).

---

### **RAID 10 (1+0, Mirroring and Striping)**

- **Purpose**: High performance and redundancy
- **How It Works**: Combines RAID 1 (mirroring) and RAID 0 (striping). Data is mirrored across pairs of disks and then striped across those pairs.
- **Advantages**:
  - High performance in both read and write operations.
  - Fault tolerance: Can survive multiple disk failures (as long as a mirrored pair isn’t lost).
- **Disadvantages**:
  - High cost due to the need for double the number of disks (like RAID 1).
- **Best Used For**: High-performance systems requiring both speed and data protection (e.g., transactional databases).

---

### **Other RAID Levels**

- **RAID 2, 3, 4**: Rarely used, as they are variations of striping with different methods of error correction and parity handling.
  
- **RAID 50, 60**: Hybrid RAID levels that combine RAID 5 or RAID 6 with RAID 0 (striping across multiple RAID 5 or RAID 6 arrays).

---

### **Software vs. Hardware RAID**

- **Hardware RAID**:
  - Uses a dedicated RAID controller (physical hardware) to manage the RAID array.
  - Provides better performance and reliability but at a higher cost.
  
- **Software RAID**:
  - RAID functionality is managed by the operating system.
  - More cost-effective but can lower system performance due to CPU overhead.

---

### **RAID Use Cases**

- **RAID 0**: Performance-critical applications (but with no data redundancy).
- **RAID 1**: Data redundancy without requiring high performance.
- **RAID 5/6**: General-purpose storage systems that need a balance between redundancy, performance, and storage efficiency.
- **RAID 10**: High-demand systems where both performance and redundancy are critical.
