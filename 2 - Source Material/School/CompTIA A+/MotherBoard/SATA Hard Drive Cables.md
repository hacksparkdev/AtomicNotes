## Summary:
**SATA (Serial ATA)** cables are used to connect storage devices like hard drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and optical drives to the motherboard inside a computer. SATA cables replaced older PATA (Parallel ATA) cables and offer faster data transfer speeds, improved reliability, and simpler connections.

## Detailed Notes:
#### Key Points:

1. **Speed**: SATA cables support various data transfer speeds based on the generation:
    
    - **SATA I (1.5 Gbps)**: Transfer rate of up to 150 MB/s.
    - **SATA II (3.0 Gbps)**: Transfer rate of up to 300 MB/s.
    - **SATA III (6.0 Gbps)**: Transfer rate of up to 600 MB/s.
2. **Physical Design**:
    
    - SATA cables have a 7-pin data connector and are much thinner and more flexible than the older PATA cables, making them easier to route inside computer cases.
    - **SATA Power Cables**: Separate from the data cable, the SATA power cable provides power to the drive. It has a 15-pin connector.
3. **Hot Swapping**: SATA supports hot swapping, which allows you to connect or disconnect drives without needing to power down the system.
    
4. **SATA Revisions**: Over time, newer SATA standards have been introduced to support faster speeds and more features, such as **SATA Express** for higher data transfer rates.
    
5. **Use Cases**: SATA cables are primarily used to connect internal storage devices. For high-performance or enterprise storage, newer interfaces like **NVMe** (using PCIe) are becoming more common, but SATA remains widely used in consumer systems.
