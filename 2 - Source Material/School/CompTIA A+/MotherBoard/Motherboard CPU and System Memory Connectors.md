## Summary:
Motherboard have a variety of connectors types. These include, CPU, Memory, I/O Ports (USB), and Adapter Cards.  These are used to add or upgrade different components.

## Detailed Notes:

- **Key Concept 1: CPU** 
	-  Most CPU's are created by AMD Or Intel these CPU sockets are made differently. 
	- When installing a CPU you will need thermal paste to stick the heatsink to. They usually always have a fan on top of them as well. This keeps them from overheating.
	
- **Key Concept 2: System Memory Slots**
	-  RAM is held in the system memory slots. 
	- It is volatile. This means the power is turned off everything that was stored on the memory is lost. 
	- It is used to send to the CPU to process and execute.
	- There is DDR2,DDR3,DDR4,DDR5. These have different speeds DIMM is used in a Desktop Computer and SODIMM is used in a laptop. 

- **Key Concept 3: M.2 Interface**
	-  These are horizontal adapters that are used for SSD. 
	- The size of the adapter may vary so make sure to check the size of the adapter before you buy a M.2 SSD. 

- **Key Concept 4: Peripheral Component Interconnect Express Interface (PCIe)**
	-  Internal expansion that uses serial point-to-point communications between devices.
	-  A card that is x8 can be plugged into a x16 plug but may not receive the same data rates. This is called up-plugging. 
	- PCIe is backwards-compatible so a version 2 card could go into a version 4 card. 
	- PCI is the legacy version. Some modern motherboard include PCI expansion buses. 
	- You can not use a PCI card in a PCIe expansion slot. 
	- PCI were originally made for 5v signaling. 3.3v is used more often. The 3.3v and 5v keyring are designed differently  to prevent from plugging them into the wrong slot.
