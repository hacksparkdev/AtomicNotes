## Summary:
In critical thinking, an inference is the process of drawing a logical conclusion based on available evidence or reasoning. It involves making connections between facts, observations, or premises to arrive at a new idea or conclusion that is not explicitly stated. Inferences are a fundamental part of reasoning because they allow you to make decisions or judgments beyond the information directly presented.

## Detailed Notes:


- **Key Concept 1: Deductive**
	-  Arguments where the premises guarantee or necessitate the conclusion.
	- If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. 
	- **Example:** 
		- Premise: All Humans are mortal
		- Premise: Socrates is human
		- Conclusion: Socrates is mortal. 
	   

- **Key Concept 2: Induction**
	- Arguments where the premises make the conclusion probable. 
	- Involves reasoning from specific observations to general conclusions.
	- **Example:**
		- Premise: Every swan I've seen is white
		- Conclusion: All swans are white (Though this is probable, it is not certain).

- **Key Concept 3: Abduction**\
	- Arguments where the best available explanation is chosen as the correct explanation.
