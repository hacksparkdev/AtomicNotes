## Detailed Notes:
Switching over to **inductive** arguments, we find an analogous set of properties. Again, inductive arguments, like all arguments, are made up of propositions, which can be true or false.

The biggest difference between deductive and inductive is that even good inductive arguments only offer probabilistic support for their conclusions. This means that accepting all the premises does not necessitate that one accepts the conclusion; it merely gives one more or less strong reason for accepting the conclusion. An inductive argument can therefore offer stronger or weaker inductive support for its conclusion. We call an inductive argument **"strong"** when the premises, if true, would demonstrate that the conclusion is likely to be true ("likely" here means that the probability is greater than 50% but less than 100%).  We call an inductive argument **"weak"** when it fails to demonstrate that the conclusion is likely to be true, even assuming the truth of the premises. 

"**Cogent**" and "**uncogent**" are the words we use in place of "sound" and "unsound" for inductive arguments since inductive arguments cannot be sound or unsound. Cogent, therefore, means all true premises, and the premises give strong inductive support for the conclusion.

Consider these two arguments:

1. I saw a black cat; therefore all cats are probably black.
2. I saw the sun rise in the east every day of my life, and everyone I know reports the same, and history books and ancient astronomers report the same, so the sun probably will rise in the east tomorrow.

## Definitions
- **Strength**
	- In an inductive argument, the truth of the premises would make the conclusion probably true. 

- **Cogent**
	-  An inductive argument is cogent if it is strong and all its premises are true.
	- **All True Premises + Strong inductive Support = Cogent Argument**

- **Abduction**
	- Drawing a conclusion based on the explanation that best explains a state of event, rather than from evidence provided by the premises. 
	- **Example**
		- Anna told you she failed her physics midterm.
		- Anna hasn't been in physics class since your teacher graded the exams. 
		- Anna has been in sociology class, which meets right after physics. 
		- Anna dropped physics.

- **Interlocutors**
	- People participating in a dialogue, debate, or conversation. 

- **Socratic Method**
	- Learning through a dialectic exchange of ideas, Rather than a passive transmission of information.
