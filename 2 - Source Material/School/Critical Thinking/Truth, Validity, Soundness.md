## Detailed Notes:
### **Key Concepts of Argumentation**

#### **1. Propositions and Truth**

- **Proposition**: A statement that can be either true or false. It describes the world and is evaluated based on whether it matches reality.
- **Truth**: A proposition is true if it accurately describes the state of the world. If it does not, the proposition is false.

#### **2. Arguments: Validity vs. Truth**

- **Arguments**: A set of premises leading to a conclusion. Arguments themselves are neither true nor false; only propositions (premises and conclusions) can be true or false.
- **Validity**: Refers to the _structure_ of the argument. An argument is valid if the truth of its premises guarantees the truth of its conclusion.
    - **Valid Argument**: If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. However, even valid arguments can have false premises (e.g., "All horses are purple").
    - **Invalid Argument**: The premises do not necessarily lead to the conclusion, even if they are true.

#### **3. Deduction vs. Induction**

- **Deductive Arguments**: Premises are intended to guarantee the conclusion.
    - Examples: Mathematical proofs, logical arguments.
- **Inductive Arguments**: Premises are intended to make the conclusion _probable_, but not certain.
    - Examples: Scientific reasoning, causal inferences, analogies.

#### **4. Sound Arguments**

- **Sound Argument**: A valid argument with all _true_ premises. This guarantees a true conclusion.
- **Unsound Argument**: Either the argument is invalid, or at least one premise is false.

#### **5. Evaluating Truth**

- To evaluate the truth of a proposition, check it against the facts. Example: If a proposition states that the GDP of the U.S. is $14 trillion, you can verify it by looking up reliable data.

## Definitions

- **Truth**
	-  A true proposition accurately represents reality. 

- **Validity**
	-  In a valid argument, if the premises were true, the conclusion would necessarily have to also be true. Validity doesn't require that the same premises have to be true. Rather, it just means that if they were true, the conclusion would have to be true too. 

- **Soundness**
	-  A deductive argument is sound if it has a valid structure and all its premises are true. (if an argument is deductive but has either an invalid structure or at least one false premise, then it is an unsound argument.)
	- **All True Premises + Valid Structure = Sound Argument**
	- The Premises entail the conclusion.
