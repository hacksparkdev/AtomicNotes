## Summary:
What makes good arguments good and bad arguments bad? How can you make a series of statements and then have "proven" or "demonstrated" a further statement? To understand arguments, start with the fundamental building blocks: propositions or statements.

## Detailed Notes:
- **Key Concept 1: Propositions**
	- Sentences that are not statements about matters of fact(or fiction). They do not make a claim that can be true or false. 
	- A  sentence and a proposition is not the same thing. Not all sentences express propositions.

- **Key Concept 2: Non-Propositions**
	- Non proposition means the sentence cannot be true or false. 
	- You cannot argue with a Non-Proposition. It wouldn't make any sense to do so. 
		- EX: "Can we please go out to dinner tonight" 
		- EX: "Wash your hands before dinner"
	- They are not statements about matters of fact. They do not make a claim that can be true or false. 
	- Arguments can only be constructed from propositions(True or False) which means that both the premise or  premises of an argument and its conclusion must always be propositions.(True or False)
	- Because an argument always requires at least on premise and conclusion, an argument will always require at least two propositions. 


- **Key Concept 3: Simple Propositions**
	-  Simple propositions are just one single statement. 
		- Example. 'It is Raining'

- **Key Concept 4: Complex Proposition**
	- A complex proposition involves multiple simple propositions combined using logical connectors(like "and", "or" "if..then", "either"). These connectors are called logical operators
	- For the "or" operator to work one of the simple propositions needs to be true.
		- Example: I am an elephant, or i am a human.
