- **Affirming the Antecedent:** AKA Modus Ponens VALID
- **Denying the Consequent:** AKA Modus Tollens VALID

- **Denying the Antecedent:** Always Invalid (Formal Fallacy)
- **Affirming the Consequent:** Always Invalid(Formal Fallacy)

## Summary:
- **Formal fallacies** = Structural errors.
- **Informal fallacies** = Content or contextual errors.
- Both weaken arguments and can mislead people into faulty reasoning.

## Detailed Notes:
### **Formal vs. Informal Fallacies**

#### **1. What are Fallacies?**
- **Fallacies** are errors in reasoning or argumentation that undermine the logic of an argument.
- They are categorized into two main types:
  - **Formal fallacies**: Errors in the *structure* of an argument.
  - **Informal fallacies**: Errors in the *content* or *context* of an argument.

---

### **2. Formal Fallacies**
- **Definition**: A formal fallacy occurs when the *structure* or *form* of the argument is invalid, regardless of the content of the premises or conclusion.
- **Key characteristic**: It’s always a problem with the logical form of the argument.

#### **Example**: **Affirming the Consequent**
- Structure:
  - If P, then Q.
  - Q is true.
  - Therefore, P is true.
- **Why it’s a fallacy**: Even if Q is true, it doesn’t necessarily mean P caused it. There could be other reasons Q is true.
  
#### **Example**: **Denying the Antecedent**
- Structure:
  - If P, then Q.
  - Not P.
  - Therefore, not Q.
- **Why it’s a fallacy**: Just because P didn’t happen doesn’t mean Q didn’t happen. There could be other ways for Q to occur.

### **3. Informal Fallacies**
- **Definition**: An informal fallacy occurs when the *content* or *context* of the argument is flawed, even if the structure is logically valid.
- **Key characteristic**: These fallacies arise from the *meaning* of words, the *relevance* of the argument, or misleading *rhetorical techniques*.

#### **Examples of Informal Fallacies**:

1. **Ad Hominem** (Attacking the Person):
   - Attacking the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself.
   - **Example**: "You can’t trust what John says about the environment; he’s not a scientist."

2. **Strawman Fallacy**:
   - Misrepresenting or oversimplifying an opponent’s argument to make it easier to attack.
   - **Example**: "Person A wants to reduce military spending. Person B responds: 'Person A wants to leave us defenseless.'"

3. **Appeal to Authority**:
   - Using the opinion of an authority figure, or someone perceived as an expert, in place of actual evidence.
   - **Example**: "A famous celebrity said this diet is great, so it must be true."

4. **False Dilemma** (Either-Or Fallacy):
   - Presenting two options as if they are the only possibilities, when in fact there may be more.
   - **Example**: "You’re either with us, or you’re against us."

5. **Begging the Question** (Circular Reasoning):
   - The conclusion is assumed in one of the premises.
   - **Example**: "I’m trustworthy because I always tell the truth."

### **4. Key Differences**:
- **Formal fallacies**:
  - Concerned with the *logical structure* of an argument.
  - Can be identified purely by analyzing the argument's form, without looking at the content.
  - Example: Denying the antecedent.
  
- **Informal fallacies**:
  - Concerned with the *content* or *context* of the argument.
  - Often involve deceptive language or irrelevant appeals.
  - Example: Ad hominem attacks.

---

### **5. Why it Matters**:
- **Formal fallacies** show when an argument is *invalid* because it breaks the rules of logic.
- **Informal fallacies** show when an argument is *misleading*, even if it appears logically valid.
- Being able to identify both types is essential for critical thinking and evaluating arguments effectively.

## Definitions:
- **Antecedent:** 
	- The proposition that follows the word "if" in any if-then statement
- **Consequent**
	- The proposition that follows the word "then" in any if-then statement.

### Denying the Consequent
This Mouse does not want any milk. But if you give a mouse a cookie, it will want some milk. Hence, you didn't vie this mouse a cookie 

Antecedent: You give a mouse a cookie. 

Consequent: it will want some milk 

Premise: This mouse does not want any milk
