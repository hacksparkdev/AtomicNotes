## Summary:

## Detailed Notes:
- **Sound Argument**
	- All Xs do Y 
	- Z is an X 
	- Therefore, Z does Y 
- **Key Concept 1: Premises**
	- If both premises are true in a argument then the conclusion must be true. 
   

- **Key Concept 2: Conclusion**
	- If we do not like the conclusion we must reject the premises. Not the Conclusion.
  
- **Key Concept 3: Argument defined**
	- Example:
		- "The new tax proposal is a good idea because it will help our school system, and anything that can help our school system is a good idea"
		- **Standard Argument form**
		 1. Anything that can help our school system is a good idea 
		 2. The new tax proposal will help our school system. 
		 3. Therefore, The new tax proposal is a good idea. 
- **Key Concept 4: How Arguments Go Wrong**\
	- **Bad Inferential structure**
		- This is when the premise does not support the conclusion. 
	- **False Premise**
		- There is something wrong with their particular content. 
	- Example:
		- **Premise 1:** All birds can fly 
		- **Premise 2:** Penguins are birds
		- **Conclusion:** Therefore, penguins can fly. 
- **Key Concept 5: Premise and conclusion indicators**
	- **Conclusion Indicators**
	- These will have a general sense of "I have told you some things or i am about to tell you some things" now here is what i want you to believe. 
	- **Common Indicators**
		- Therefor 
		- So 
		- It follows that 
		- Hence 
		- Thus 
		- Entails that 
		- We may conclude that 
		- Implies that 
		- Wherefor 
		- As a result
	- **Premise Indicators**
	- These have the general sense of "From this fact i am going to infer something else"
	- **Common Indicators**
		- Because  
		- For 
		- Given that 
		- In that 
		- As 
		- Since 
		- As indicated by
