Let's create a schedule that balances your college coursework with learning the necessary skills to become an influential figure in cybersecurity. Since you work from 3 PM to 12 AM and want your study schedule to be from 8 AM to 1:30 PM, we’ll make sure you have time for both your classes and skill development.

Here’s a proposed schedule for a typical week:

### **General Guidelines:**
- **Work Hours**: 3 PM to 12 AM
- **Study Time**: 8 AM to 1:30 PM
- **Off Days**: Tuesday & Wednesday (focus more on learning skills these days)
- **Weekends**: Light focus on coursework or skill review if needed

---

### **Weekly Schedule Outline:**

#### **Monday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday**
(Regular workdays; 8 AM to 1:30 PM is for college work and skill learning)

**8:00 AM – 9:00 AM**  
- **College Coursework**  
  Focus on assignments, readings, or preparing for exams. Use this time to tackle the most challenging parts of your schoolwork (like CompTIA A+ material).

**9:00 AM – 10:30 AM**  
- **Skill Development: Programming (Python/Go)**  
  Work on Python and Go skills. Practice coding by building small programs related to cybersecurity (automating tasks, creating scripts for vulnerability testing, etc.).

**10:30 AM – 11:00 AM**  
- **Short Break**  
  Grab a coffee or take a short walk to refresh your mind.

**11:00 AM – 12:00 PM**  
- **Cybersecurity Specialization**  
  Focus on red team (offensive) or blue team (defensive) tasks. Work through platforms like Hack The Box or TryHackMe. Spend this time on learning pen-testing, incident response, or other key areas.

**12:00 PM – 1:00 PM**  
- **Content Creation Practice / Writing**  
  Spend this time writing a blog post or Medium article. Use this time to reflect on what you've learned during your cybersecurity practice and how it can be turned into teaching material.

**1:00 PM – 1:30 PM**  
- **Philosophy & Life Organization Study**  
  Dedicate 30 minutes to philosophy readings (like *Meditations* or other related materials) and develop thoughts on life organization, personal growth, and how to incorporate them into your content.

#### **Tuesday and Wednesday (Days Off)**

**8:00 AM – 9:00 AM**  
- **College Coursework**  
  Focus on reading and homework assignments.

**9:00 AM – 10:30 AM**  
- **Advanced Programming Skills**  
  Focus on more complex projects or tasks with Python/Go that challenge you. Try integrating these languages into security tasks, such as building a small tool or script for your SOC project.

**10:30 AM – 11:00 AM**  
- **Break**

**11:00 AM – 12:30 PM**  
- **Red Team/Blue Team Training**  
  Deep dive into offensive (pen-testing, exploit development) or defensive (SIEM, threat hunting) topics. You can spend this time building labs, using online platforms, or practicing through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

**12:30 PM – 1:30 PM**  
- **Content Creation & Branding**  
  Focus on creating content for your cybersecurity brand. Work on an article, a YouTube video outline, or update your LinkedIn with your latest projects. Reflect on how to weave philosophy and life organization into your content.

---

### **Daily/Weekly Adjustments:**
- **Daily Planning:** Each morning, spend 5-10 minutes planning your key goals for the day in your journal.
- **End of Week Review (Saturday or Sunday):** Dedicate 30 minutes at the end of the week to review your progress. Reflect on what went well, what needs improvement, and set goals for the upcoming week.

---

### **Key Points to Consider:**
- **Prioritize College Work on Busy Days**: If a deadline is approaching or a particularly hard assignment is due, prioritize that over skill learning.
- **Focus Deeply on Skill Days**: Use Tuesday and Wednesday for deep work on cybersecurity skills, programming, and content creation since you have no work distractions.
- **Balance**: Since you’re juggling a lot, don’t be afraid to adapt this schedule if you feel burnout approaching. Consistency is more important than intensity.

Does this schedule feel manageable, or would you like any adjustments?
