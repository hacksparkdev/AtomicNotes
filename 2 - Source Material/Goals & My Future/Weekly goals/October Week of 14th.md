## üéØ **Goal Planning Template**

### üåü **Long-Term Vision**
- **Cybersecurity Vision:**  
  *(What does success in cybersecurity look like for you? Specify job roles, skills, projects, etc.)*
	-  I want to learn to program in terms of Cybersecurity,  so GO, Python, C, C++, Bash, PowerShell. I want to be able to know exactly what is going on in a network and how to work quickly to defend it. I also want to know how to penetrate systems. 


- **Writing Vision:**  
  *(What kind of writer do you want to be? What topics, audience, or formats do you envision?)*
  My vision is to be able to write in a way that can express my ideas and show my character. I want to be able to write so people will engage with my content and want to share there opinion as well. I want to be able to get my point across in a clear and concise way but also be myself. Be funny, happy, and informative.  I want to be able to formulate my opinions on subjects in cyber security and in philosophy and be able to mix the two in a way that is cohesive. 
  
- **Brand Vision:**  
  *(What kind of personal or professional brand do you want to build? What platforms, style, and content?)*
  - Success in Cyber Security looks like me building a brand and helping people learn the skills they need for life and Cybersecurity. I want to build a tribe of people who can defend or attack a organization. They need to know how to write, programs on the fly that could be used in penetration testing as well as for defending.
