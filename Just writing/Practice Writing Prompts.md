### **Step 2: Practice Writing Prompts**

Write 3-5 introductions daily using these prompts:

- “Explain why [topic] is important and promise to help solve it.”
- “Use a comparison (like simulators/pilots) to introduce a concept.”
- “Ask a thought-provoking question to hook the reader.”

Here’s a template to get you started:

    Hook: Open with something intriguing (quote, statistic, or analogy).
    Relate: Connect it to the reader’s needs or curiosity.
    Promise: Tell them why they should keep reading and what value they’ll get.
