## Notion Automation Project

This project was created to help me take notes while i was in the terminal and send the notes to notion so they would be saved. It was a fairly easy project. It is pretty much useless. The only reason i created it was so i could work on my python skills. It would be useful to reference if i ever need any help connecting to a API.
